Bee Game- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/lSLvPRyZZ

I tried to create code that spawned a bee and a hive. Te goal was to have the bee change once it interacted with the hive. But something was wrong with the distance function and I was unable to get this to work. To try and fix this problem I re coded the Bee and the hive to be set in the upper left corner. When both sprites where there the distance was zero. But once the hive was spawned the distance was all over the place. It was extremly inconsistent and becuase of that I was unable to change the sprite.
